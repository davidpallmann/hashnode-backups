## Hello, EventBridge!

#### This episode: Amazon EventBridge and event-based processing. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon EventBridge and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to connect software components using events. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

# Amazon EventBridge : What is it, and why use It?

> "Not being able to govern events, I govern myself." â€”Michel de Montaign

Event-driven architectures use events to communicate between decoupled services. An event is simply a message that reflects a state change or an update, such as placing an order or running out of an item in inventory. Event-driven architectures are commonly used to interconnect microservices. With event-driven architectures, there are no point-to-point connections between software; instead, everything flows through a common event bus. You can easily add or remove software components without having to modify existing components.

[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge) (hereafter "EventBridge") is a message service for event-driven applications. AWS describes it as "a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events generated from your applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services". EventBridge can interconnect not only your own services, but also 90+ AWS services and 20+ SaaS applications. 

Typical message latency between sending and receiving an event is about half a second, but this can vary. EventBridge has an [uptime SLA](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/sla/) of 99.99% (4 9's). 

You pay for events published in EventBridge. All state change events published by AWS services by default are free. Custom events, opt-in AWS service events, and third-party SaaS events are charged at $1 per million events published. Always confirm latest rates and terms on the [pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/).

## Concepts

The core concept of an event bus is that you have a collection of decoupled software components that can have conversations using the publish-subscribe model. Any component can send messages to signal events. Any component can listen to events, filtered to what they are interested in. 

**Events** are messages that signal a system's state has changed, such as completed delivery of a package. You'll typically have a variety of event types, each with its own attributes.

**Producers** (also called Sources) generate events. For example, an order service might generate *new order* events.

**Consumers** (also called Targets) receive event messages. For example, a delivery service might receive events about packages ready for delivery.

An **event bus** receives events from producers and routes them to consumers, using rules.

A **rule** matches incoming events against an event pattern and sends them to up to 5 targets (consumers). You can also have scheduled rules, which perform actions at regular intervals. 

![diagram-eventbridge-producers-consumers.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656269083530/DAEL55WfV.png align="left")

An event bus is limited to a single AWS region, but you can achieve routing across commercial AWS regions using [global endpoints](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-global-endpoints-for-amazon-eventbridge/), which replicate events sent to an event bus to another event bus in a secondary region.

# Our Hello, EventBridge Project

We will write a .NET producer program and a .NET consumer program, and connect them with EventBridge. We will also add CloudWatch Logs as another consumer. Each message sent by the producer will arrive at both consumers.

## One-time Setup

For any of the tutorials in the Hello, Cloud series you need the following:

1. An  [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/), and an understanding of what is included in the  [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/what-is-free-tier/). 
2. [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). If you're using an older version of Visual Studio you won't be able to use .NET 6. If you use a different IDE, you may have to find alternatives to some tutorial steps.
3. [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/). You'll need to [configure the toolkit ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/keys-profiles-credentials.html) to access your AWS account and create an IAM user. Your default AWS profile will be linked to this user when running programs from the command line.

## Step 1: Create Event Bus

In this step, you'll create an event bus in the AWS management console.

1. Sign in to the AWS console. At top right, select the region you want to work in. You can check supported regions for EventBridge on the [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) page. I'm using **us-west-2 (Oregon)**.

2. Navigate to **Amazon EventBridge**. You can enter **eventbridge** in the search bar.

3. Select **Event Buses** and then **Create Event Bus**.

4. Name your event bus **hello-eventbridge** and click **Create**.

    ![aws-create-event-busy.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656178437606/po8pD5KQy.png align="left")

    ![aws-create-event-bus-success.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656178861902/l5CWkGAO9.png align="left")

6. Create a rule that catches all events and sends them to a target:

    A. On the left navigation pane, select **Rules** and click **Create rule**. 

    On the Step 1: Define rule detail page:

    B. For rule name, enter **all-events**.

    C. Under Event Bus, select **hello-eventbridge**.

    D. Click **Next**.

    ![create-rule-01.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656184131675/1yIftY5Am.png align="left")

    On the Step 2: Build event pattern page:

    E. For Event Source, click **Other**.

    ![create-rule-02a.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656184503423/aTSstqxDj.png align="left")

    F. Under Event Pattern, enter the JSON below. This pattern will match all messages from source `hello-eventbridge/producer`.

   ```json
{
  "source": [
    "hello-eventbridge/producer"
  ]
}
```

    G. Click **Next**. 

    ![create-rule-02b.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656185772986/s9w9BV_we.png align="left")

    On the Step 3: Select targets page:

    H. Select Target type **AWS service**.

    I. Select target **CloudWatch log group**.

    J. For Log Group, enter **hello-eventbridge**. This target configuration will send matching events to the Amazon CloudWatch log group `/aws/events/hello-eventbridge`.

    K. Click **Next** and **Next**. 

    ![create-rule-03.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656185186055/vrVvd-olo.png align="left")

    On the Review and create page:

    L. Click **Create rule**.

    ![create-rule-04.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656185891690/PiV1SXNa8.png align="left")

## Step 2: Create a .NET Product program

In this step, you'll create a .NET console program that will be a producer, writing events to the event bus.

1. In a command/terminal window, CD to a development folder.

2. Issues the `dotnet new` command below to create a new console program named `hello-eventbridge-producer`.

    ![dotnet-new.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656178515131/CPg_OCvJp.png align="left")

3. Launch Visual Studio and open the `hello-eventbridge-producer` project.

4. Add the **AWSSDK.AmazonEventBridge** package to the project.

    ![nuget.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656179038479/k2uTCe48l.png align="left")

5. Add a class file named `TestEvent`. Open TestEvent.cs in the code editor and replace it with the code below at the end of this step. This class represents a test event.

6. Open Program.cs in the code editor and replace it with the code at the end of this step. On line 7, update the RegionEndpoint to reflect the region you are using.

    This code creates an `AmazonEventBridgeClient` and uses it to publish an event, by creating a `PutEventRequests` object and passing it to the `PutEventsAsync` method. The request specifies producer source `hello-eventbridge/producer`, the same source specified in our event pattern in Step 1.

7. Save your changes and build the program.

TestEvent.cs

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace hello_eventbridge_producer
{
    public class TestEvent
    {
        public string Id { get; set; } = null!;
        public string Message { get; set; } = null!;
        public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Program.cs

```csharp
using Amazon;
using Amazon.EventBridge;
using Amazon.EventBridge.Model;
using System.Text.Json;
using hello_eventbridge_producer;

var client = new AmazonEventBridgeClient(RegionEndpoint.USWest2);

var evt = new TestEvent()
{
    Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
    Message = "Test event",
    Date = DateTime.Now
};

var response = await client.PutEventsAsync(new PutEventsRequest()
{
    Entries = new List<PutEventsRequestEntry>
    {
        new PutEventsRequestEntry
        {
            DetailType = "test-event",
            EventBusName = "hello-eventbridge",
            Source = "hello-eventbridge/producer",
            Detail = JsonSerializer.Serialize(evt)
        }
    }
});

Console.WriteLine($"Sent test event {evt.Id} to event bus, response status {response.HttpStatusCode}");


```

## Step 3. Test the Producer

In this step, you'll run the producer program and view the event received by CloudWatch Logs.

1. In a command/terminal window, CD to the project folder.

2. Run the command `dotnet run`. You see confirmation in the console output that an event was published along with its ID.

    ![dotnet-run-01.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656186337930/okot-59Oe.png align="left")

3. Now, we'll check CloudWatch Logs to see if the event was received.

    A. In the AWS console, navigate to **Amazon CloudWatch**.

    B. Select **Log groups** from the left panel. A group named `/aws/events/hello-eventbridge' should be listed. 

    ![cloudwatch-log-groups-01.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656186538590/ty4B1H9hG.png align="left")

    C. Click `/aws/events/hello-eventbridge`. A log stream should be listed.

    ![cloudwatch-log-groups-02.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656191544230/okYNAGxWD.png align="left")

    D. Click the log stream to view the log.

    ![cloudwatch-log-groups-03.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656191739206/zjkXFr2hD.png align="left")

    Expand the log entry to see the JSON of the message. Under the `detail` property, you see the test event object sent by the producer program.

    ![cloudwatch-log-groups-04.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656191906402/njt7yms1x.png align="left")

Congratulations! You've published an event to EventBridge from .NET code, and confirmed receipt by a consumer, CloudWatch logs.

## Step 4: Create a Consumer Lambda

In this step, you'll create a .NET AWS Lambda function to be another consumer of events. 

1. In a command/terminal window, CD to a development folder.

2. Enter the `dotnet new` command below to create a Lambda function named `hello-eventbridge-consumer`.

    ```dos
dotnet new lambda.EmptyFunction -n hello-eventbridge-consumer
```

    ![04-dotnet-new.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656192255029/46tACzx35.png align="left")

3. Launch Visual Studio and open the `hello-eventbridge-consumer` project.

4. Add the **Amazon.Lambda.CloudWatchEvents** package to the project. Note: Cloud Watch Events was the original name of EventBridge. This package is needed to understand the incoming EventBridge message structure.

    ![04-nuget.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656193290516/fB5Plw7FS.png align="left")

5. In Solution Explorer, add a class named `TestEvent` to the project. Open `TestEvent.cs` in the code editor and replace it with the code at the end of this step. This is the same event structure used by the producer.

6. Open Function.cs in the code editor and replace it with the code at the end of this step. The Lambda function logs the details of the EventBridge message it receives.

7. Save your changes and build the program.

TestEvents.cs

```csharp
namespace hello_eventbridge_consumer
{
    public class TestEvent
    {
        public string Id { get; set; } = null!;
        public string Message { get; set; } = null!;
        public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Function.cs

```csharp
using Amazon.Lambda.Core;
using Amazon.Lambda.CloudWatchEvents;

// Assembly attribute to enable the Lambda function's JSON input to be converted into a .NET class.
[assembly: LambdaSerializer(typeof(Amazon.Lambda.Serialization.SystemTextJson.DefaultLambdaJsonSerializer))]

namespace hello_eventbridge_consumer;

public class Function
{
    /// <summary>
    /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="input">Test event</param>
    /// <param name="context">logging context</param>
    /// <returns></returns>
    public void FunctionHandler(CloudWatchEvent<TestEvent> input, ILambdaContext context)
    {
        context.Logger.LogLine($"Lambda consumer received test event Id: {input.Detail.Id}, Message: {input.Detail.Message}, Date: {input.Detail.Date}"); 
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Publish Lambda Function to AWS and Test

In this step, you'll publish your consumer Lambda function to AWS, configure it to receive test events, and test that it works. 

1. Publish the Lambda function to AWS:

    A. In Solution explorer, right-click the `hello-eventbridge-consumer` project and select **Publish to AWS Lambda**.

    B. On the wizard, confirm the region is set correctly.

    C. For Function Name, enter **hello-eventbridge-consumer**.

    D. For Handler, enter **hello-eventbridge-consumer::hello_eventbridge_consumer.Function::FunctionHandler**.

    E. Click **Next**.

    ![04-publish-01.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656193993290/Ll6_uDiKh.png align="left")

    F. On the Advanced Function Detail page, select a Role Name for Lambda execution. If you don't have one, create a role in the AWS console with basic Lambda execution permissions and return to this step.

    G. Click **Upload**.

    ![04-publish-02.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656194114770/Fu6XGLkc6.png align="left")

    ![04-publish-03.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656194207784/b2bEn1rwp.png align="left")

    H. Wait for publishing to complete, after which you should see `Last Update Status: Successful` at the top center of the screen.

2. Add the Lambda function as a target to the `all-events` EventBridge rule you created earlier:

    A. In the AWS console, navigate to **Amazon EventBridge**. 

    B. On the left panel, select **Rules** and click on the **all-events** rule.

    C. Add a second target, with Target type AWS service, Target Lambda function, function name **hello-eventbridge-consumer**.

    ![05-rule-config.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656196500410/Rg9UqHXpH.png align="left")

   D. Click **Next**, **Next**, and **Update Rule**. Your rule now has two targets: CloudWatch Logs and the consumer Lambda function.

    ![05-rule-config-02.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656196329475/M7W7ZDY-s.png align="left")

## Step 5: Test the Consumer Lambda Function

In this step, you'll again run the producer to send an event, and verify the event was received and processed by the consumer Lambda function.

1. In a command/terminal window, CD to the `hello-eventbridge-producer` project folder and run the program with `dotnet run`. The program runs, and an event is sent to your event bus.

    ![05-dotnet-run-producer.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656196742939/6C-lRGYyY.png align="left")

3. View your Lambda function and logs in the AWS console:

    A. In the AWS console, navigate to **AWS Lambda**.

    B. Select **Functions** from the left pane and click on the `hello-eventbridge-consumer` function.

    C. The metric dashboards should show that the Lambda function was invoked once.

    ![05-lambda-logs-01.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656196974284/XQrh9PtTU.png align="left")

    D. Click the **View logs in CloudWatch** button, and go to the new browser tab that opens. You see a log stream listed.

    ![05-lambda-logs-02.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656197089322/xtt0Q0nBY.png align="left")

    E. Click the log stream to view the log detail. You see a log entry from your consumer Lambda function echoing the detail of the test event it received.

    ![05-lambda-logs-03.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656197261165/4Vr4Kcu8S.png align="left")

4. To confirm there are now two consumers subscribed to these events, view the other consumer, `CloudWatch Logs /aws/events/hello-eventbridge`:

    A. Navigate to **CloudWatch > Log Groups > /aws/events/hello-eventbridge**. 

    B. Click the newest log stream. You see your test event.

    ![05-cloudwatch-logs.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656197666579/JmNLnfKmt.png align="left")

    Congratulations! Your C# Lambda function was triggered in response to an EventBridge event, and was able to access the event details. 

5. Optional: if you'd like to take the project further, here are some things you could try:

    A. Create additional publishers and consumers.

    B. Create a second type of event message.

    C. Have a consumer also publish a message. Be care to avoid infinite loops in your message processing!

## Step 6: Shut it Down

When you're finished with this hello-eventbridge tutorial, shut it down. You don't want to accrue charges for something you're not using.

1. In the AWS management console, navigate to **AWS Lambda** and delete the `hello-eventbridge-consumer` function.

2. Navigate to **Amazon EventBridge** and delete the `all-events` rule.

3. Delete the `hello-eventbridge` event bus.

# Where to Go From Here

Event-driven architectures and decoupled microservices are popular today for some solid reasons. You do away with point-to-point connections between software, which allows you to easily add or remove components without having to touch other components. Decoupled microservices can be independently scaled. Auditing become easy, you just add another consumer to your messaging.

In this tutorial, you write a .NET producer that sends messages to an EventBridge event bus, and a .NET consumer that processes messages received from the event bus. You set up a rule that matched event patterns and routed messages to two targets.

This tutorial did not cover built-in integrations to SaaS products, or many features. To go further with EventBridge, get familiar with these features and evaluate whether they make sense for your use case: archive and replay events, schema registry, built-in integrations to other AWS services, scheduled events, and global endpoints.
