## The .NET on AWS Community

Today, community is vital to software development. The developer who is plugged into community benefits from the latest news, tools, industry connections, educational content, best practices, open source projects, and places to ask for help and advice. The developer who works in a bubble misses out on those things. Community is not only a place to receive those benefits but also to contribute, which is a great way to both help out and make a name for yourself. 

Just where is the community for .NET on AWS developers?  In this post, we'll review some different places. A handy site to bookmark is the [.NET on AWS Community page](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/language/net/net-community/).

## Twitter

## AWS Developers Slack

AWS Developers Slack is a pubic slack workspace hosted by AWS for the AWS developer community. The #dotnet channel is for .NET discussions, and #dotnet-news carries the same feed of announcements and content posted to Twitter.

Slack is a great place to post questions and have discussions. Although you can also post questions on Q & A sites like AWS re:Post and Stack Overflow, Slack allows you to have nuanced, multi-party discussions. It's also moderated to be a safe, friendly place to ask developer questions.
