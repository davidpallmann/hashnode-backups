## Hello, MediaConvert!

#### This episode: AWS Elemental MediaConvert and video transcoding. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce MediaConvert and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to transcode video. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

# AWS Elemental MediaConvert : What is it, and why use It?

> "If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video is worth a million." â€”Troy Olson

Video has taken over as the most popular medium, especially with younger generations. From television to social media, video is everywhere. Consequentially, more and more organizations use video in their products, advertising, or education. For consuming video, a one-size-fits-all approach is doomed to failure: there is no single video encoding that will play well across the variety of connected devices and resolutions. To deliver video content with broadcast quality to a broad audience, transcoding is necessary. Transcoding converts video from one encoding format to another, in order to support varying resolutions and streaming bandwidth. 

[AWS Elemental MediaConvert](https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/) (hereafter "MediaConvert") is a service that transcodes video. AWS describes it as "file-based video transcoding service with broadcast-grade features". With MediaConvert, you can create video-on-demand (VOD) content suitable for multi-screen delivery and broadcast, and do so at scale.

The "Elemental" in the AWS Elemental MediaConvert name refers to a family of AWS Elemental media services you can combine: 
* [MediaPackage](https://aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/) prepares and protects video for deliver to Internet devices.
* [MediaTailor](https://aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/) is a linear channel assembly and personalized ad insertion service. 
* [MediaLive](https://aws.amazon.com/medialive/) is a broadcast-grade live video processing service.
* [MediaStore](https://aws.amazon.com/mediastore/) is a storage service optimized for media.

MediaConvert works with jobs. A job takes an input video and converts it to multiple outputs to support a variety of devices and resolutions. Many [broadcast and Internet delivery formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/reference-codecs-containers.html) are available. Your outputs can include stand-alone files, such as an MP4 file, and sets of files for adaptive bitrate streaming, such as an Apple HLS package.  You work with jobs and files, and don't need to create or maintain any video processing infrastructure.

A simple workflow is to upload a source video to an input S3 bucket and launch a job. The job processes the input and generates transcoded video to an output bucket. 

![diagram-simple-workflow.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657999595195/H9VMckLbN.png align="left")

More complex workflows can involve AWS Step Function workflows for ingestion, processing, and publishing. Lambda functions can react to new input or output video files, and a CloudFront distribution CDN can be used for delivery.

![diagram-complex-workflow.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657998224860/wQZF3vUcK.png align="left")

MediaConvert has no minimum fees and offers both on-demand and reserved pricing. In on-demand-pricing, you are charged per minute of video output. Always check the current pricing model on the [pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/pricing/).

# Our Hello, MediaConvert Project

We'll first create input and output S3 buckets, then write a .NET program that launches a MediaConvert job. The job will transcode a source video to MP4 and MOV formats.

## One-time Setup

For any of the tutorials in the Hello, Cloud series you need the following:

1. An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/), and an understanding of what is included in the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/what-is-free-tier/). 
2. [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). If you're using an older version of Visual Studio you won't be able to use .NET 6. If you use a different IDE, you may have to find alternatives to some tutorial steps.
3. [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/). You'll need to [configure the toolkit ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/keys-profiles-credentials.html) to access your AWS account and create an IAM user. Your default AWS profile will be linked to this user when running programs from the command line.

## Step 1: Create AWS Buckets and IAM Role

In this step, you'll use the AWS management console to create S3 buckets for video files, and an IAM role. The role grants MediaConvert permission to access your S3 buckets.

1. Sign in to the AWS management console and select the region you want to work in. We're using **us-west-2 (Oregon)**.

2. Create two S3 buckets:

    A. Navigate to **Amazon S3**.

    B. Create a bucket named **hello-mc-input**. If the bucket name is in use, try a variant. This is the bucket we will upload source videos to. Record the name of your input bucket.

    ![01-create-bucket-input.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658002379577/DsylugGgK.png align="left")

    C. Create a bucket named **hello-mc-output** or similar.  This is the bucket MediaConvert will output transcoded video to. Record the name of your output bucket.

3. Create an IAM role that will give MediaConvert permission to access your S3 buckets.

    For MediaConvert to read and write from an S3 Bucket and emit status events to CloudWatch, we need to create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for MediaConvert to assume. An IAM Role defines a set of permissions to be assumed by a trusted entity, such as a user, service, or application.

    A. Navigate to **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**. 

    B. On the left pane, select **Roles** then click **Create role**.

    C. Select Trusted entity type **AWS Service** ad use case **MediaConvert**, and click **Next** until you reach the Name, review and create page.

    D. For Role name, enter **MediaConvertRole** and click **Create role**.

    E. Once the role is created, search for and select it. Record the role's Amazon Resource Name (ARN), which will be of the form `arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXX:role/MediaConvertRole`.

## Step 2. Write a .NET Program for Media Conversion

In this step you'll write a .NET 6 program that creates a MediaConvert job.

1. Open a command/terminal window and CD to a development folder.

2. Enter the dotnet new command below to create a console program named **hello-mediaconvert**.

    ```dos
dotnet new console -n hello-mediaconvert
```

3. Open the hello-mediaconvert project in Visual Studio.

4. In Solution Explorer, right-click the `hello-mediaconvert` project and select **Manage NuGet Packages...**. Find and install the **AWSSDK.MediaConvert** package.

    ![02-nuget.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658000514852/E6puXvGDo.png align="left")

5. Open Program.cs in the editor and replace with the code at the end of this step. 

    a. set `mediaConvertRole` to the IAM role ARN you copied in Step 1. 

    b. set `inputBucket` to the input bucket name you used, with an s3:// prefix.

    c. set `outputBucket` to the output bucket name you used, with an s3:// prefix.

    d. Set `region` to the region you're working in.

6. Save your changes and ensure you can build the program.

Program.cs

### Understand the Code

The code looks pretty long, but that's mostly due to MediaConvert's large number of settings for video and audio. Our example and settings were derived from an example in the AWS documentation, but we could have configured our outputs in the AWS MediaConvert portal, generated JSON, and converted that to C# code.

The code first checks for the expected filename parameter on the command line, assigned to `filename`. This is the name of the video file in our input S3 bucket. It's also used to set `prefix`, a prefix for the output files, minus the file type. If our input file is `Giraffe_close-up.webm`, the output files will have names like `Giraffe_close-up_1.mp4` and `Giraffe_close-up_2.mov`.

Next, the MediaConvert endpoint is determined. MediaConvert client setup is a little different from most AWS services. To get our customer-specific endpoint, we first create an `AmazonMediaConvertClient`, passing in our region. From that, we call `DescribeEndpointsAsync` and take the first one. Now that we have our endpoint, we instantiate a replacement `AmazonMediaConvertClient` with the endpoint we just retrieved. Now we're ready to submit jobs.

The job request is most of the code, and region directives mark the major sections. It includes video settings, audio settings, an output group defining the output encodings to generate, and the input video. Creating a job is achieved with a call to `CreateJobAsync`, and the response includes an Id we display. The program exits here, and we must go to the AWS console to determine when the job has finished.

## Step 3: Run the Program and Test Media Conversion

Now it's time to upload an input video, run our .NET code, and transcode video. 

1. In the AWS management console, navigate to S3 and view your input bucket. 

2. Upload a video to the S3 input bucket that you have rights to use. We're using the following full-resolution video from Wikimedia Commons, [Giraffe close-up.webm](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Giraffe_close-up.webm) from the Copenhagen zoo, Creative Commons Attribute-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic license.

    ![01-webm.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658005156555/_JgbpeiWI.png align="left")

    ![01-webm-s3.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658005371299/5qOBFCCmv.png align="left")

3. Open a command/terminal window and CD to the project location.

4. Run the `dotnet run` command with -- {filename} on the command line, where {filename} is the name of the video you uploaded to your S3 input bucket (use quotation marks if the name contains spaces):

    ```dos
dotnet run -- "Giraffe_close-up.webm"
```

    The console output will confirm creation of the job.

    ![03-dotnet-run-giraffe.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658062279139/uUiFohUg-.png align="left")

5. In the AWS console, navigate to **MediaConvert** and select **Jobs** from the left pane. You should see your job listed, with status PROGRESS, COMPLETE, or ERROR. 

    If your job is running successfully, you'll see a status of PROGRESSING:

    ![03-aws-job-progress.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658016901283/EEWjlFMSP.png align="left")

    An error looks like this, and might occur if you misspelled your video name:

    ![03-aws-job-error.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658006859509/KYhgPzpJr.png align="left")

6. Wait for the job to complete, refreshing the view as needed.

    ![03-aws-job-complete.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658006926585/xOG4xMvoO.png align="left")

7. Click on the job name to see its detail. You see there are two outputs listed.

    ![03-aws-job-complete_detail.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658017159274/FKjMwh7UQ.png align="left")

8. Navigate to **S3** and view your `hello-mc-output` bucket, which was previously empty. There should now be two videos in the bucket, an .MP4 file and a .MOV file.

    ![03-output-bucket-mp4.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658008425485/E6uMsUXHt.png align="left")

9. Download and play the .MP4 video. 

    ![03-output-bucket-mp4-objurl.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658007158582/fT69nt9nw.png align="left")

    ![03-mp4-play.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658007279195/FYhLFUyte.png align="left")

10. Download and play the .MOV video.

    ![03-mov-play.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658009011606/-PYHsb3MK.png align="left")

    Congratulations! You've performed video transcoding using AWS Elemental MediaConvert and the AWS SDK for .NET.

11. Try other video files, by repeating the above steps for a different source video. For example, [NASA Earthrise - the 45th anniversary](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NASA_-_Earthrise-_The_45th_Anniversary_dE-vOscpiNc.webm), NASA, public domain. Try multiple input videos in the same job.

    ![03-mp4-play-space.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658013966573/kDjWHaaK6.png align="left")

## Step 4: Shut it Down

When you're all done with Hello, MediaConvert, shut it down. You don't want to accrue charges for something you're not using.

1. In the AWS management console, navigate to **Amazon S3**. 

2. Delete the objects in the input S3 bucket, then delete the bucket.

3. Delete the objects in the output S3 bucket, then delete the bucket.

# Where to Go From Here

As video continues to grow in importance, so does the need for transcoding. AWS Elemental MediaConvert provides easy, on-demand transcoding with professional features for high-quality video.

In this tutorial, you created input and output S3 buckets and wrote a .NET program to launch MediaConvert jobs. You saw uploaded video files transcoded to multiple output formats. We used MediaConvert in the simplest way possible. We did not cover broadcast features like graphic overlays, content protection, multi-language audio, close captioning, or advanced transcoding. Look through the job templates in the AWS console to get a running start on your configuration. To go further, review the documentation, evaluate the features against your requirements, and experiment until you gain proficiency.
