## Hello, ElastiCache!

#### This episode: Amazon ElastiCache and distributed caching. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon ElastiCache and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET website. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

# ElastiCache : What is it, and why use It?

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." â€”Phil Karlton 

Modern cloud applications can often benefit from a third data storage option in addition to in-memory variables and persistent storage: a distributed caching layer. You can make use of caching to boost appication performance, reduce pressure on your back-end database, or as the store for non-durable datasets. A caching layer provides a high-speed data store for efficient re-use of previously retrieved data. A distibuted cache uses multiple servers for high availabiliy.

[Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) is a distributed memory cache service. AWS describes it as "a fully managed, in-memory caching service supporting flexible, real-time use cases". Elasticache is fast, with sub-millisecond response times.

When using the cache in front of a data store, you can use the following pattern. An application wanting to retrieve data can first check the cache. if the desired data is not found (a **cache miss**), the data is fetched from the data store, but is also written to the cache to benefit future requests.

![diagram-cache-miss.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1663528018049/HzAuHQS6x.png align="left")

The next time the same data is needed, it's found in cache (a **cache hit**) if it hasn't expired. The trip to the data store is unnecessary, and data retrieval is faster.

![diagram-cache-hit.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1663528237033/0VwFtVoje.png align="left")

However, front-ending a data store is not the only use for a cache. You can also use it as the primary store for some short-lived data where no persistent data store is needed. For example, you could capture votes for a survey that way, where only the results need to saved.

ElastiCache supports two engines, Redis and Memcached. Both are in-memory key-value stores that support a popular caching protocol. If your applications already use Redis or Memcached, that will make choosing easy. If not, see [Comparing Memcached and Redis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/SelectEngine.html).

You don't need the AWS SDK to talk to your Redis ElastiCache clusters. You can use the StackExchange.Redis API. This means your cache code can stay the same across environments, even if some of them use Redis caches not hosted on AWS.

A limitation of ElastiCache clusters is that they can only be accessed by EC2 instances. That means you can't get to the cache when testing locally from your development machine. If you want to test your application locally, you'll need to code around this limitation. For local testing, you can either use a different Redis cache not hosted in ElastiCache, or use a mock for the cache.

With ElastiCache, you are charged hourly based on the number of nodes, node type, and pricing model you select. The AWS Free Tier allows new AWS customers to receive 750 hours of ElastiCache cache.t2.micro or cache.t3.micro node usage for free for up to 12 months. See the [Pricing Page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=5) for details.

# Our Hello, ElastiCache Project

Our project will create a handful of simple Razor pages for voting on a cuisine for a team dinner. Vote results will be captured in an ElastiCache Redis cluster.

[source code](https://github.com/davidpallmann/hello-elasticache)

## One-time Setup

For any of the tutorials in the Hello, Cloud series you need the following:

1. An  [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/), and an understanding of what is included in the  [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/what-is-free-tier/). 
2. [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). If you're using an older version of Visual Studio you won't be able to use .NET 6. If you use a different IDE, you may have to find alternatives to some tutorial steps.
3. [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/). You'll need to [configure the toolkit ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/keys-profiles-credentials.html) to access your AWS account and create an IAM user. Your default AWS profile will be linked to this user when running programs from the command line.

## Step 1: Create an ElastiCache Redis Cluster

In this step, you'll use the AWS consile to create an ElastiCache Cluster with the Redis engine.

1. Sign in to the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). At top right, select the region you want to work in. You can check supported regions for [ElastiCache] on the [Supported regions & endpoints page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/RegionsAndAZs.html#SupportedRegions). I'm using **us-west-2 (Oregon)**.

2. Navigate to **ElastiCache**.

3. Create a subnet group:

    A. On the left pane, select **Subnet groups**.

    B. Click **Create subnet group**.

    C. Name: **hello-elasticache**.
    
    D. VPC ID: Select your default VPC.

    E. Ensure you have multiple subnets listed across multiple availability zones.

    F. Click **Create**.

    ![create-subnet.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1663529733308/BgZjt1w_2.png align="left")

4. Click **Create cluster** and make the following selections:

    A. On the left pane, select **Redis clusters**.

    B. Click **Create Redis cluster**.

    C. Choose a cluster creation method: **Configure and create a new cluster** (default).

    D. Cluster mode: **Disabled** (default).

    E. Name: **hello-elasticache** (if name is in use, create a variation)

    F. Location: **AWS Cloud** (default).

    ![create-cluster-1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1663530691518/hFBAVY4So.png align="left")

    G. Engine version: latest choice (default).

    H. Port: **6379** (default).

    I. Node type: **cache.t3.small**.

    J. Number of replicas: **2** (default).

    K. Subnet groups: select the **hello-elasticache** subnet group you created earlier.

    L. Click **Next**, **Next**, and **Create**.

    ![create-cluster-2.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1663530699960/oZTAmuN0k.png align="left")

   M. It may take a few minutes for the cluster to be created. When the cluster status shows **Available**, it is ready for use.

5. Get the cluster endpoints. Click the **hello-elasticache** cluster to views its detail. Record the **Primary endpoint** and **Reader endpoint** URLs.

    ![create-cluster-3-endpoints.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1663531452387/V-_5ibmt0.png align="left")

5. Add an inbound rule to your default VPC allowing port 6379:

    A. Navigate to **VPC > Security Groups**.

    B. Click on the security group for your default VPC, which should say *default VPC security group* in its Description.

    C. On the **Inbound rules** tab, click **Edit inbound rules**.

    D.  and add an inbound rule to your default VPC permitting access over port 6379:

    E. Add a rule for Type **Custom TCP**, port **6379**, Source **0.0.0.0/0**. 

    ![vpc-sg-inbound.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664790450957/8sDGwTvec.png align="left")

    F. Click **Save rules**. 

    ![vpc-sg-inbound-added.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664789966678/HZBlQoXXP.png align="left")

## Step 2: Develop a Voting Web App

In this step, you'll create a web project with the dotnet new command, then write code to make it a voting app that uses ElastiCache to store votes. We'll have these Razor pages:

| Razor Page | Code-behind | Purpose |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| Index.cshtml | Index.cshtml.cs | Shows the question and links to vote |
| Vote.cshtml | Vote.cshtml.cs | Casts a vote |
| Votes.cshtml | Votes.cshtml.cs | Shows the voting results |

1. Open a command/terminal window and CD to a development folder.

2. Run the  `dotnet new` command below to create a new web project named **hello-elasticache**.

    ```dos
dotnet new webapp -n hello-elasticache
```

    ![dotnet-new.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1663535445229/fDNjUZNgN.png align="left")

3. Open the `hello-elasticache` project in Visual Studio.

4. Add NuGet packages **Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json** and **StackExchange.Redis**.

5. Update the code to make this a voting application:

    A. Open `appsettings.json` in the code editor, and replace with the code below at the end of this step. Replace `hello-elasticache-primary-endpoint:6379` with the primary endpoint you recorded in Step 1. Replace `hello-elasticache-reader-endpoint:6379` with the reader endpoint. When the code-behind pages need to access the Redis cache, they will retrieve these configuration endpoints.

    B. Open `Index.cshtml` in the code editor, and replace with the code below at the end of this step. This is a voting page that allows users to vote on a dinner choice by selecting a button. The vote links invoke the Vote page, specifying a cache key parameter.

    C. Open `Index.cshtml.cs` in the code editor, and replace with the code below at the end of this step. This is the landing page code-behind page. There's no code of interest here.

    D. In Solution Explorer, create `Vote.cshtml` by making a copy of `Index.cshtml` and renaming it Vote.cshtml. Open `Vote.cshtml` in the code editor, and replace with the code below at the end of this step. This page casts a vote.

    E. Open `Vote.cshtml.cs` in the code editor, and replace with the code below at the end of this step. This is the voting code-behind page. In this and the voting results page, the cache is accessing using the  StackExchange.Redis API. To access the cache, the `OnGetAsync` method retrieves the primary and reader endpoints from appsettings.json and calls `ConnectionMultiplexor.Connect' to create a ConnectionMultiplexor named `Redis`. Calling `Redis.GetDatabase` method gives us an `IDatabase` interface, which is what the code uses to store or retrieve cache values. To cast a vote, `db.StringIncrementAsync` increments a string value by one, using the cuisine cache key that was passed as a query parameter. This method automatically creates the key if it doesn't already exist. This is how we remember votes that have been cast.

    F. Add a new Razor page named `Votes.cshtml`. This page will show the voting results.

    G. Open `Votes.cshtml` in the code editor, and replace with the code below at the end of this step. The code retrieves the vote count for each cuisine from cache and stores it in its model, which the Razor page displays. 

    H. Save all changes and ensure the project builds.

appsettings.json

```json

  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using StackExchange.Redis;
using System.Web;

namespace hello_elasticache.Pages;

public class VotesModel : PageModel

        {
            Message = ex.ToString() + "<br/>" + ex.StackTrace;
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Publish to AWS Elastic Baanstalk

In this step, you will deploy your Razor page voting app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk from Visual Studio. Since you can't access ElastiCache from your local machine, we'll need to test it in the cloud.

1. In Solution Explorer, right click the `hello-elasticache` project and select **Publish to AWS**.

2. Select **Publish to New Target** and **ASP.NET Core App to AWS Elastic Beanstalk on Linux**.

    ![publish-to-aws.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664793888417/reIVf_72K.png align="left")

3. Keep all defaults, and click **Publish**.

4. Wait for the Publish action to complete.

5. Copy the details at right, and note the endpoint address of the published web application.

## Step 4: Run the Program and Test ElastiCache

Now it's time to run our .NET code and see ElastiCache work. 

1. In a browser, navigate to your web application's endpoint URL you copied in the previous step.

2. You see a welcome page, with a question and some choices.

    ![test-01-home.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664792973792/B0aZ5n2AZ.png align="left")

3. Click on one of the choices, such as **Italian**, which takes you to the vote page, with the cuisine cache key in a query parameter: `http://hello-elasticache.....elasticbeanstalk.com/vote?id=cuisine-Italian`

    ![test-02-vote.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664793132463/Ixmd2027w.png align="left")

4. Click **See Votes**, which will take you to the votes page. You see the vote you cast, confirming that the vote was stored in cache and was retrieved successfully.

    ![test-03-votes.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664793214483/Db8MAC-r9.png align="left")

5. Return to the original page and cast more votes.

6. Click **See Votes** to see the results, confirming that the cache has captured all the votes.

    ![test-04-votes.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664793384375/M0BubXRgq.png align="left")

Congratulations! You've used ElastiCache to store and retrieve values from .NET code using the StackExchange Redis API.

## Step 5: Shut it Down

When you're finished with the tutorial, delete the AWS resources. You don't want to be charged for something you're not using.

1. Delete the Elastic Beanstalk deployment:

    A. Open a command window, and navigate to the project folder.

    B. Delete the Publish to AWS deployment with this command:

    ```dos
dotnet aws delete-deployment hello-elasticache
```

    ![delete-deployment.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664794641866/41ANTsyFt.png align="left")

2. Delete the ElastiCache cluster:

    A. In the AWS console, navigate to **ElastiCache > Redis clusters**.

    B. Select your `hello-elasticache` cache cluster.

    C. Select **Delete** from the **Actions** dropdown, and confirm.

    ![delete-cache.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664794845414/kjrw-f3zV.png align="left")

# Where to Go From Here

Caching makes your web applications faster and more efficient, and relieves database pressure. Amazon ElastiCache is AWS's fully managed, in-memory caching service that you can use with Redis or Memcached engines.

In this tutorial, you learned the basics of ElastiCache for Redis and wrote a simple .NET voting application that stored vote counts and retrieved them. You used the StackExchange Redis API to access the cache, just as you typically would any Redis cache.

This tutorial did not cover the Memcached engine, and only lightly explored Redis. To go further, work with ElastiCache in a real use case, learn Redis well, and review the resources linked below.
